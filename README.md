Individually completed work for CMPEN 472: Microprocessors & Embedded Systems (Penn State). Demonstrates HCS12 assembly, PORTB I/O, RTI, timers/PWM, UART, ADC, waveform generation, memory control and a serial monitor using CodeWarrior on MC9S12C128.

Academic honesty: Shared for portfolio review only; do not reuse for coursework. All responsibility falls on the students copying, as I have no intention comitting any academic dishonesty nor do I tolerate any forms of academic integrity violations.
Note: Most of these requirements change based on the semester taken.
